# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This project focuses on sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort and so on) and Big O Notation in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Bash 5.0.17(1)
* All files compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* Vi Editor
